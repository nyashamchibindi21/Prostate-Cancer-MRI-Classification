# 🔬 Prostate Cancer MRI Classification App

This Streamlit-based web application uses **Deep Learning** to classify prostate MRI scans as either **Normal** or **Suspicious**.  
It leverages a pre-trained **TensorFlow model** to assist radiologists and researchers in identifying potential signs of prostate cancer in MRI images.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is for **educational and research purposes only**. It should **not** be used as a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.

## 📦 Installation Guide

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/prostate-cancer-classifier.git
cd prostate-cancer-classifier
````

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

(Replace `app.py` with your actual file name, e.g., `prostate_cancer_app.py`)

---

## 📋 Requirements

Ensure your `requirements.txt` contains:

```
streamlit
numpy
tensorflow
pydicom
pillow
protobuf==3.20.*
```

## 🧠 Model Information

* The model file: `prostate_cancer_classification_model.h5`
* Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
* Task: Binary classification (Normal vs Suspicious)
* Input size: 224×224 RGB MRI image
* Output: Confidence score + predicted class label

If you don’t have the model, you can train your own using prostate MRI datasets from:

* [Kaggle: Prostate MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [TCIA: The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
